This is a git repository for the Murach's Javascript and DOM Scripting book. In this repository will be: test code, sample applications, sample code, and libraries given by the book. As I work through this book I will be updating my progress on GitHub.com so that I can become familiar with git and github while simultaneously learning JavaScript. Two birds with one stone.
